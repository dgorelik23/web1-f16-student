	TRAN NGUYEN is an award-winning illustrator and gallery artist. Born in Vietnam and raised in the States, she is fascinated with creating visuals that can be used as a psycho-therapeutic support vehicle, exploring the mind's landscape. Her paintings are created with a soft, delicate quality using colored pencil and acrylic on paper.
	Nguyen has worked for clients such as VH1, Tor Books, Chateau St. Michelle Winery, and has showcased with galleries in California, New York, and Italy. She is currently represented by Richard Solomon and Thinkspace gallery. (photo by Greg Preston)
