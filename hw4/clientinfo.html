<h3>Client Needs</h3>

<p>Gabby is a junior in Animation here at MassArt. She currently doesn't have a website or portfolio and is looking to get started on making one. She needs a professional website to store her animations and display them to potential clients and friends. She has a Vimeo account, and is open to posting animations on there and linking them to her site.

Gabby wants a simple wesbite with a modern feel, but one that doesn't feel too sterile. I think that by adding her artwork and animations, the site will instantly feel more lively and fun. She likes yellow and purple, which are possible color palette ideas for the website's look. Gabby also prefers softer and rounder elements, so we should avoid using a lot of sharp, pointy features if possible. Overall, the site should be simple and easy to use, but still fun and welcoming. Gabby also expressed interest in having a responsive website that translates across all platforms, from desktop to mobile.

As for content, Gabby will need a site that supports multimedia features, such as a video player, audio player, and still images. She wants to include a homepage with a gallery that links to her projects, so that each project has its own page with more information about it. Since she has animation, 2D art and sound design, the site might need to have multiple sections for each kind of media that all link to the same homepage or navigation menu. In addition, it needs to include a bio page and contact information, such as social media links and email.

Some possible site visitors include: future employers, clients, peer artists and animators, followers and kids interested in animation. The site needs to be professional-looking, but not overly serious. I'll need to meet with Gabby again to talk about branding her as an animator/artist. This will require possibly coming up with a logo/icon to use on the site, as well as typeface choices and a set color palette. Since Gabby doesn't have a set idea about her website, she needs more help coming up with a layout and visual feel.
