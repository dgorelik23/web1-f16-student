<li><a href="https://yemayema.myportfolio.com/">Yema Yema</a>
<p>This is the portfolio site of artist Mercedes Crespo. I find her website's layout to work very effectively in presenting her art and animation. I also like her navigation bar and personal icon, which is something we can similarly use on Gabby's site.
	
<li><a href="http://www.sachinteng.com/">Sachin Teng</a>   
<p>Sachin Teng's portfolio website has a well-designed gallery for browsing his various projects. The grid structure and easy-to-read names are something I'd also like to utilize</p>

<li><a href="http://www.adhemas.com/">Adhemas Batista</a>
<p>This site puts the artist's work front and center. I love the use of huge, colorful images in a more dynamic grid format. The larger format requires more scrolling, but it also makes it feel more immersive, which might benefit an animation portfolio.</p>
