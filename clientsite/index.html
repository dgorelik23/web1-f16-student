  <h1>Hi! I'm Gabby.</h1>
  <p>Born Gabriella Nicole Rodriguez, from Rockport, MA and currently attending Massachusetts College of Art and Design for animation. She found animation at an early age like most children with Disney movies. As she grew older, she realized that she liked the storytelling aspect of movies along with the character designs and decided that she would study animation. Now in her Junior year of college, her love of animation is still there, even though it’s super hard. She loves to watch horror movies and play video games, is super into dogs and musicals and has a weird fondness for 80’s disco music.</p>
