<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
Although I already have a Behance portfolio, I would like to design my own portfolio website to showcase my work. I am a graphic design student, so the maority of my work consists of design projects, but I also enjoy making illustrations and would like to include those on my site as well. That way, if friends, family or potential clients would like to see all the kinds of work I do, they can visit my site and see everything in one place. I would want my site to have a landing page, a small "about me" or bio page, and then two separate pages for my graphic design and illustration projects. I would also like to include links to my behance profile and my instagram account, since those are the two social networks where I post my projects. I'd like to create a simple, modern-looking website that's not too flashy, since my projects should be the focal point of the site.  I don't really have or want to tell some kind of story about myself, since I'd rather just showcase my work and have people contact me if they'd like to know more. My main goal is to just show visitors that I am a designer and an illustrator.
